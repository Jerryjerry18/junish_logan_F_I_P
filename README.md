# Junish_Logan_FIP

This is our FIP for Interactive Media Design. Junish made the homepage and the error page, and logan made the about-us/contact-us page, the beers page, and the XD file.

We have animations in our website when you click the VIEW BEERS button at the top right, hover over any of the nav tags and the beers on the beers page. There is a video in tne middle section of the website, which we made in Cinema 4D/ Adobe After Effects. When you hover over the three different flavours we serve images, the colour changes behind it. Next, there is a contact form where you type your name, email, & message. After that is images of people enjoying the beer where if you click on those images it shows a lightbox thanking you, and a map of where we are, followed by a footer.

The about us page is a page talking about the people who own the website/company, which was made from our Dynamic Team Page assignment but edited to fit our FIP. You click the buttons that say know more, which is where information about both of us is displayed using JavaScript.

Our third page, the beer page, where if you hover over the beer it zooms into it and then hovering away zooms out. Clicking on the beer opens information talking about what kind it is, and there is a nutrtional facts button whereas if you click that button it tells you the nutritional facts on a table and has a pink and blue background behind it. If you click on the logo, it takes you back home again.

For the last links, we have an error page with a sorry message saying we are still working on this, and then a button below that which allows you to go back to the main page again.
