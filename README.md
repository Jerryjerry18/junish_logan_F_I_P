# Junish_Logan_FIP

This is our FIP for Interactive Media Design. Junish made the homepage and the error page, and logan made the about-us/contact-us page, the beers page, and the XD file.

We have animations in our website when you click the VIEW BEERS button at the top right, hover over any of the nav tags and the beers on the beers page. There is a video in tne middle section of the website, which we made in Cinema 4D/ Adobe After Effects. When you hover over the three different flavours we serve images, the colour changes behind it. Next, there is a contact form where you type your name, email, & message. After that is images of people enjoying the beer and a map of where we are, followed by a footer.
